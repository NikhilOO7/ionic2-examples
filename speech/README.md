# Text to Speech Example

On Android, speaking with different locales will not work without some configuration. You have to navigate pretty deeply into your settings:

Settings > Language & input > Speech > Text-to-speech output > Google Text-to-speech Engine > Install voice data

You'll see a list of locales; if you click on one you'll see a screen with a download button. A given locale will become available after you finish downloading the voice files for it. Note that, unlike on iOS, non-English voices are unable to switch to English when they encounter English text; instead, they just spout gibberish.
